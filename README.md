# CHATBOT IN JAVA 8



This is a simple chatbot which I had created in JAVA for a school project. You can chat with it as long as you like. You can play a number game with it or ask it the capital of any country.
# Prerequisites :

JAVA 8 (JDK and JRE)

# How To Run

In the Terminal (Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) type :

javac Alice.java

java Alice

# Instructions

When communicating with the Chatbot :

1. Do not use SMS language.
2. Do not give a vague statement. Try to input a complete well formed statement.
3. For punctuation marks (or any special character), place it immediately after the word and then leave a space before you start the next word. (For example : Hello, how are you doing?)
4. To exit type : #exit#
5. To play the number game type : #play number name#
